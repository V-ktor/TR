DRIFTER_WIZARD_INIT,"You had hoped that your life will change from now on. In fact it did, but not only in good ways."
DRIFTER_WIZARD_NO_REASON_TO_STAY,"One day you decided that you suffered enough from the humiliation of your master. By now you mastered simple spells and your master is not willing to teach you any new spells anyway. So there is no reason to stay."
DRIFTER_WIZARD_SPELL_BOOK_THEFT,"However, before you leave this place forever you should at least take a keepsake. You know that the old wizard hides some powerful spells books hidden in his laboratory. Maybe he won't even notice the disappearance of one of those books."
DRIFTER_WIZARD_BASEMENT,"So you head down to the basement of the manor. You know the old wizard well enough to know that he placed a few traps down here. This place is also guarded by a few imps."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LOCKED,"The door to the workroom is locked. You expect to the tomes to be in there."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_ENTER_LAB,"You enter what appears to be a laboratory."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB,"You don't know what the purpose of this place is, but you have heard the rumours about experiments on {race}. Of course they are just rumours."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_APPROACHING,"A tiny red imp approaches you."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_KNOWN,"He is a servant of the old wizard. You don't like this guy. He would always yell at you, but maybe he is just not able to speak in a non-offensive tone at all."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_NOT_ALLOWED,"''MASTER DOES NOT ALLOW USELESS APPRENTICE TO ENTER THE LABORATORY''"
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_WHAT_DOING,"''WHAT IS APPRENTICE DOING HERE?''"
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_BACK_TO_WORK,"''BACK TO WORK LAZY SCUM''"
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_LAB_ACCESS,"''NO NO, PLEASE DON'T TELL MASTER\nMASTER HURTS\nME GOOD IMP, ASK IF APPRENTICE NEEDS SOMETHING''"
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_INTRUDER,"''INTRUDER\nMASTER WILL BE VERY ANGRY''"
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_IMP_ATTACK,"You engage the imp in combat."
WIZARD_IMP_DEFEATED,"You managed to defeat the devilish creature."
WIZARD_IMP_KEY,"You find a key that the creature was carrying."
WIZARD_IMP_LOST_SIGHT,"The imp lost sight of you."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_DARK,"It's dark. The room is only dimly lit by strange crystal devices."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_CRYSTAL_DEVICES,"Irregular crystals cased in metallic contraption emit pale light. Metal pipes and cables stretch across the room."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_CRYSTAL_DEVICES_FAMILIAR,"The devices resemble magical devices used for enhancements but they differ in some essential details. You have no idea what the use of these devices could possibly be."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_INVESTIGATE_DEVICES,"Investigate the devices."
WIZARD_CAST_LIGHT,"Cast a light spell."
WIZARD_CAST_FIRE,"Conjure a flame."
WIZARD_LAB_LIGHT_BLOB,"You conjure a light blob to illuminate the room."
WIZARD_LAB_FLAME,"You conjure a flame hovering above your hand. The room became somewhat brighter."
WIZARD_LAB_FLAME_FAILED,"Conjuring a flame sounds easier than it actually is. You burned your hand in the process but finally there is a small flame hovering above your hand. The room became somewhat brighter."
WIZARD_LAB_CANDLE,"You snap with your fingers and the candle starts burning. The room became somewhat brighter."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_ILLUMINATED,"Now that this place is brighter you have a better view of the situation."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_CORPSES,"You see four beds and three corpses - at least you think that these people are dead. Some of the cables are attached to the corpses."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_APPROACH_CORPSES,"You approach the nearest bed. A naked women lies on the bed. Her body clearly shows signs of decay, yet her arms and legs are constrained by heavy chains."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_VOMIT,"You vomit all over the place."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_VOMIT_IMP,"You hear the imp behind you making angry noises."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_CORPSES_STATUS,"Metallic cables are attached to the arms and legs of the dead women. Faint light pulsates beneath her decaying skin in the same rhythm as the crystal connected to the cables. It's the same for the other two corpses."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_SEARCH_LAB,"Search the laboratory."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_SEARCHED,"You search the laboratory more carefully but the only useful thing you find is a {item}."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_SEARCHED_FAILED,"You search the laboratory more carefully but you find nothing."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_DOOR,"The door to the room is heavy but opens slowly while you push it with your shoulder leaning against it. Once the door is opened you hear loud noise coming from inside the room."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_OPERATION,"After stepping inside you see what causes the noise: various machines work hot glowing metal with large hammers. Everything moves on its own. You don't know how this is possible.\nThe room is lit up by the glowing metal and the furnace."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_ENTER_FORGE,"You enter the automated forge. The room is filled with the deafening noise of hammer blows."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_EXAMINE_METAL,"Examine the metal."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_METAL,"The metal is hot and glowing white. You can't tell what exact metal it is."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_EXAMINE_HAMMER,"Examine the hammers."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_HAMMER,"You approach the closest hammer. It is hovering in the air, moving on its own it thrusts down onto the piece of metal. On impact sparks fly from the metal.\nYou count five hammers in total."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_EXAMINE_CONTRAPTION,"Examine the metallic contraption."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_CONTRAPTION,"On a table standing in the other side of the room lie several metallic contraption. There is an empty socket in the centre. You don't know what purpose these devices have but they appear to be the end product of the forge."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_CONTRAPTION_REMIND,"They look very similar to the devices in the laboratory."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_CONTRAPTION_GAINED,"As they are not too large you decide to take one of the devices with you."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_SEARCH_FORGE,"Search the forge."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_SEARCHED,"You find a {item} lying on the floor and a candle in one of the shelves. The other stuff in the room appears to be uninteresting except for some strange metallic contraption."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_FAILED_SEARCHED,"You find nothing useful except a candle in one of the shelves. A strange metallic contraption catches your eye."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_SEARCH_FORGE_AGAIN,"Search the forge more carefully."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_SEARCHED_AGAIN,"You search the forge once again. This time you focus on hidden panels and false bottoms. You notice a {item} that you missed earlier. Finally, you find the key you were looking for glued on the inside of one of the drawers."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_FORGE_SEARCHED_AGAIN_FAILED,"You search the forge once again. This time you focus on hidden panels and false bottoms. While you don't find any at first, you find the key you were looking for glued on the inside of one of the drawers."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_BURNED_HAND_CANDLE,"You wish you knew before burning your hand..."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_WHERE_KEY,"You have searched both rooms but you haven't found a key for the workroom yet. There must be a way to open the door."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LOOK_FOR_KEY,"You know the old wizard well enough to know that he must keep a spare key somewhere. He often leaves things. Maybe you should check the shelves for a false bottom."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_OPEN_WORKROOM,"The key fits and the door opens."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_ENTER_WORKROOM,"You enter the workroom."
WIZARD_WORKROOM_MESS,"You see a large desk in the middle of the room. Several layers of paper sheets and scrolls cover most of the desk. Ink is spilled on a few of the papers. It's a mess."
WIZARD_WORKROOM_SHELVES,"Two shelves stand on the left and right side of the room. Each of them filled with dusty books. You lose no time and search for any ancient tome or at least some spell books. You find none though. Most of the books are pretty old and you don't even understand which topics they cover. Some are even written in unknown languages. Other books look rather new but you can't make out any sense of the texts as they seem to contradict everything you know about magic.\nYou put the books back into the shelves. Maybe you're able to find some clues on what is going on in this basement."
WIZARD_WORKROOM_SEARCH_DRAWERS,"Search the drawers."
WIZARD_WORKROOM_DRAWERS,"You search the drawers of the desk. In one drawer you find a {item}. The rest is not interesting except a faintly glowing crystal that you find in the last drawer. You recognize it as a magical crystal that is used for enchantments."
WIZARD_WORKROOM_DRAWERS_FAILED,"You search all the drawers but without much success. In the very last drawer you find a faintly glowing crystal. You recognize it as a magical crystal that is used for enchantments."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_COMBINE_DEVICE,"You found both, an empty device and an crystal similar to the devices in this room. You try to put the crystal into the socket of the empty device and it fits perfectly! The device has attachments for pipes just as the other devices in this room."
WIZARD_BASEMENT_LAB_REEXAMINE,"Take another look at the machinery."
WIZARD_LAB_MACHINERY,"You take another look at the devices. Each of them is connected to a corpse by metallic pipes that extend deep beneath the skin. But some of the pipes instead go to another device hanging down from the ceiling right in the middle of the room that you have overlooked earlier. This device looks slightly different. It is covered with metal plates, thus you cannot see if it also holds a crystal in its socket."
WIZARD_LAB_REACTION,"Holding the device in your hand you stand quite close to one of the corpses. You notice that there is some kind of reaction. The crystal in the device glows slightly brighter and pulsates with the same frequency as the connected device. You step closer and the light grows brighter in return."
WIZARD_LAB_REANIMATE,"You bend over the corpse but flinch back when it suddenly moves abruptly towards you. The arms and legs are fixated on the table with rusty shakles that make loud noises as the corpse tries to move forward."
WIZARD_LAB_IMP_CORPSE,"The imp says ''DON'T WAKE THE SLEEPERS\nSTUPID APPRENTICE WILL MAKE MASTER ANGRY''"
WIZARD_LAB_MACHINES_ACTIVE,"As sudden the corpse came to life it collapsed again. While it shows no more reactions the connected machines have activated. The crystals are glowing brighter and the central machine produces weird noises."
WIZARD_LAB_IMP_ANGRY,"''MASTER WILL BE VERY ANGRY''\nWith these words the imp flies away."
WIZARD_LAB_MACHINE,"You step closer to the machine. You still don't know what is going on and you don't know what the purpose of these machines is either. You're not even sure whether these people are dead or not. You don't have much time to think about it, though, because the machine is just finished and one of the steel panels slides open."
WIZARD_LAB_SCROLL,"Ones the dust settled it reveals a scroll with ornate handles. You touch the paper and realize that it is hot. Orange glowing glyphs appear where you have touched the paper and spread over the entire scroll, then vanish quickly."
TAKE_SCROLL,"Take the scroll."
WIZARD_LAB_TAKE_SCROLL,"You take the scroll. It's not exactly what you were looking for but it appears to be a magical artifact nevertheless. Maybe you will be able to figure out what is going on here by studying the scroll. It's time to leave this place."
WIZARD_APPEARING,"You go towards the staircase but someone is going downstairs. You have no time to hide. A wizard wearing a dark cloak stands in front of you."
WIZARD_REPLY_KNOWN,"He says: ''I know what you did. Too bad, I had use for someone like you.''"
WIZARD_REPLY_UNKNOWN,"He says: ''Another intruder it seams. You came farther than the others, though.''"
WIZARD_SCROLL_NOTICED,"He notices the scroll you are holding.\n''Now that's interesting. Luckily your interference hasn't resulted in failure it seems. Of course I can't let you go with this artifact.''"
ASK_WHY_HE_DID,"Ask why he did these horrible things."
ASK_WHAT_HE_DID,"Ask what he did here."
ASK_MORE,"Ask more questions."
WIZARD_ANSWER_WHY,"''My research will benefit all {race}. The scroll you're holding in your hand is a breakthrough that is going to save all of us.''"
WIZARD_ANSWER_WHAT,"''You're holding the result of my work in your hands. Too bad that you will never find out what it is.''"
WIZARD_ANSWER_NO,"''Enough, I will not answer any more questions. You're not able to understand the importance of my work anyway nor will you be able to leave alive. However, damaging the scroll would be very unfortunate. Will you be so kind to hand it back?''\nHe looks angry."
WIZARD_READ_SCROLL,"You're not sure why but you decide to take a closer look at the scroll even if it's the last thing you do in your life. You open the scroll."
WIZARD_SCROLL_EXAMINE,"You are familiar with magical runes and formulas, but to your surprise you find nothing like that on the scroll."
WIZARD_SCROLL_COMENT,"''Go ahead, try to use it. But you should know, no one within the last 100 years were able to use the ancient scrolls. Even I, who managed to replicate one, am not capable of reading them. My plan was to use you for experiments as you seem to have some... connection. But there's no way you could read the scroll.''"
WIZARD_SCROLL_DISINTEGRATING,"The scroll turns to dust. It starts at the edges and quickly spreads over the entire scroll. Soon enough all of the paper is gone."
WIZARD_WHAT_DONE,"''What have you done???''"
WIZARD_BLACK_OUT,"Walls begin to shift. Bricks move through the air and split or remerge into larger blocks. You're not sure what is going on. Everything becomes darker and darker and you black out."
WIZARD_WAKE_UP,"Finally, you wake up and find yourself in a large empty room. Your surroundings look much different than what you remember. No one else is here."
WIZARD_NEW_ROOM,"The room is large and cylindrical. It's empty except for a few torches on the walls. There is a single staircase on one side of the room leading up."
WIZARD_NEW_BUILDING,"You go upstairs. This building is no longer the place you knew. The layout of the building is completly different and the outer walls appear to be circular. Even more puzzling is the fact that all rooms are empty."
WIZARD_OUTSIDE,"You leave the building. From outside you see that it is a tall tower with cylindrical base. The surrounding buildings also look different than what you remember and their architecture is unfamiliar. The buildings have rounded corners and circular elements that you don't remember from any building you have seen in this city."
WIZARD_CITY,"You wander the streets and see more unfamiliar buildings and people you never met before. Just as you conclude that you somehow have woken up in a different place you enter a part of the city that you remember from earlier. It appears parts of the city and its people have been replaced, as weird as it sounds."
WIZARD_ASK_AROUND,"You ask some people on the streets what has happened but they are as puzzled as you. They tell you that in some parts of the city all buildings just have turned into completely new ones. Also, some people have gone missing."
MERCENARY_COMPANION,"{he/she} is part of the group of mercenaries that you've recently joined."
MERCENARY_INIT,"Soon after you joined a group of mercenaries you received your first job. While the payment is good the job appears to be very dangerous. You have to raid the tower of a powerful wizard and capture him - dead or alive."
MERCENARY_SPLIT,"You split into two groups. The first one, the larger group, will enter the tower and fight the wizard. Your group has to kill all the creatures around the tower and make sure that the entrance remains open. In fact the tower is surrounded by undead creatures. You head straight to the closest group of zombies while the other group rushes past them and heads inside."
MERCENARY_ZOMBIE_NOISE,"Zombies react on loud noise so {name} makes noise to draw their attention from the other group."
MERCENARY_ZOMBIE_ATTACK,"The zombies have noticed your presence and approach you."
MERCENARY_ZOMBIES_DEFEATED,"You have defeated the zombies outside the tower."
MERCENARY_ZOMBIES_STILL_DEFEATED,"You let the other mercenaries of your group deal with the zombies."
MERCENARY_ROOKIE,"{name} asks you: ''How are you holding up, rookie?''"
MERCENARY_GREAT,"''Great!''"
MERCENARY_DIEING,"''I'm dieing!''"
MERCENARY_GREAT_RESPONSE,"''I'm glad to hear. Take this {item} anyway, just in case.''"
MERCENARY_DIEING_RESPONSE,"''Here, take one of these {item}s.''"
MERCENARY_MORE_ZOMBIES,"You make your way to the entrance. The other group is still not back.\nYou hear noises coming from inside and after a brief moment more zombies walk outside through the entrance."
MERCENARY_GROUP_NOT_BACK,"With the undead creatures slain you did your part of the job. The fate of the other group is yet unknown."
MERCENARY_START_TO_WORRY,"''They should be back by now.'' says {name}.\n{leader} replies: ''The entrance is safe but there might be more monsters inside than expected. We should help the others.''"
MERCENARY_ENTER_TOWER,"You carefully enter the tower. The ground floor appears to be cleared. The fighting sounds had lured all the zombies outside where you have slain them."
MERCENARY_HALL,"You are standing in a large hall with luxurious furniture. There are, however, signs of a battle. You see a few undead corpses and blood stains. The other group went through here you conclude."
MERCENARY_POCKET,"You see {name} pocketing a golden trinket."
MERCENARY_NO_TIME,"We don't have time for this."
MERCENARY_LEAVE_SOMETHING,"Leave something for me!"
MERCENARY_INTERVENE,"{name} intervenes: ''Hey you two, we don't have time for this! The others might be in trouble.''"
MERCENARY_STAIRCASE,"You proceed to the staircase and decide to go downstairs."
MERCENARY_BASEMENT,"This place is dark and probably dangerous. There are no signs of the missing group."
MERCENARY_ENTER_LAB,"The room is filled with strange devices and faintly glowing runes are carved in the walls. You spot a pile of corpses in one of the corners."
MERCENARY_NECRO,"''This guy is a necromancer.'' {name} said."
MERCENARY_LAB_SEARCH,"You search the laboratory and find a {item}. There is also a switch on one of the walls. The effects of triggering it are unknown. Will you pull the switch?"
MERCENARY_LAB_SEARCH_FAILED,"You searched the laboratory but you haven't found anything useful. There is, however, a switch on one of the walls. The effects of triggering it are unknown. Will you pull the switch?"
MERCENARY_LAB_SWITCH,"You pull the switch. There is a distant clicking noise but nothing else appears to happen."
MERCENARY_BASEMENT_FORGE_DOOR,"You hear noise coming from this room. The door to the room is heavy but you're strong enough to open it with ease. While opening the door, the noise is growing louder."
MERCENARY_FORGE_SEARCH,"There are lots of iron bars and unfinished weaponry in this room. You grab one of the few finished {item}s. Meanwhile {name} just pulled a lever he found without thinking twice."
MERCENARY_FORGE_SEARCH_FAILED,"There are lots of iron bars and unfinished weaponry in this room. This stuff is too heavy to carry it with you, though. Meanwhile {name} just pulled a lever he found without thinking twice."
MERCENARY_WORKROOM_LOCKED,"The door is locked. It looks too heavy to be broken up by force easily so you have to look for another way to open."
MERCENARY_WORKROOM_OPEN,"The door that was locked until now is open."
MERCENARY_IMP_ATTACK,"A group of imps appears. One of them says: ''MORE INTRUDERS. KILL THEM ALL.''"
MERCENARY_IMPS_DEFEATED,"The imps were defeated."
MERCENARY_ENTER_WORKROOM,"You enter a room with large shelves full with books and scrolls."
MERCENARY_ILITERATE,"You can't even read so the books and scrolls are uninteresting to you."
MERCENARY_SEE_SCROLL,"However, one of the scrolls stands out from the messy piles of paper. While it has a high quality and golden ornaments cover the handles this is actually not the reason why it stands out. Something draws you to the scroll. It feels unfamiliar but very important."
MERCENARY_GRAB_SCROLL,"You grab the scroll. The feeling intensivies.\n{name} taps on your shoulder, ''You fine?''\n{leader} says: ''They're apparently not here. Let's head upstairs.''"
MERCENARY_GO_UPSTAIRS,"The three of you head back towards the stair case. However, a large figure wearing a dark cloak appears in front of the stair case. It says: ''What do we have here? More of those pesky merceneries? So annoying...''\n''Do me a favor and hold still for a moment.''"
MERCENARY_DEAD,"The hands of the dark wizard glow blue and orange. {leader} and {name} draw their weapons but before they could move any closer {leader} burns to ash and {name} is impaled by several large ice spikes. They instantly drop dead."
MERCENARY_STILL_ALIVE,"You don't dare to move. It went so quickly that you haven't even drawed your weapon. You're still holding the scroll you found earlier in your hands. This is probably what has saved you for now.\nThe wizard says: ''The scroll. Will you be so nice and give it to me? You will die anyway but there is no need to risk damaging the scroll.''"
MERCENARY_READ_SCROLL,"You're not sure why but you decide to take a closer look at the scroll even if you are about to die. Thus you open the scroll."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_ILITERATE,"You can't read and you are not familiar with magical runes so there really is no point in trying."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_UNMAGICAL,"You are not familiar with magical runes so there really is no point in trying."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_MAGICAL,"You are familiar with magical runes but what you see is nothing like the runes you know."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_SHIFTING,"The thick paper is covered with complex geometrical patterns that are difficult to grasp. They are hard on your eyes and almost seam to be constantly shifting. You try to concentrate on the patterns but they become blury."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_COMENT,"Meanwhile the wizard is doing nothing but watching you. Finaly he says: ''Haha! That would have surprised me! These scrolls are ancient artifacts that only a handful of individuals are capable of reading and a pitiful {race} such as yourself is surely not one of those. Slightly disappointing but expected. Now...''"
MERCENARY_SCROLL_LOCK_IN,"You take another look at the scroll. This time the patterns are visibly moving. They seem to lock in place and suddenly, for a brief moment, you know exactly the meaning behind it."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_IMPOSSIBLE,"''This is impossible!'' the wizard says."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_DISINTEGRATING,"The scroll turns to dust. It starts at the edges and quickly spreads over the entire scroll. Soon enough all of the paper is gone. Only now you look up and see that it also spreads to the entire room. The nearby walls have holes and the ceiling also begins to crumble while the floor below you turns into sand."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_WIZARD_GONE,"The wizard is gone by now, disintegrated into a cloud of sand, same as your dead comrades."
MERCENARY_SCROLL_CLOUDS,"As the environment turns into sand, clouds of sand rise up. Eventually you can't see anything."
MERCENARY_ENDING_WAIT,"You wait until the dust settles. Now that you are able to see your environment better you notice that the tower is completly gone. You only see the bare ground. Everything within about 100 meters just vanished."
MERCENARY_ENDING_MOVE,"You reach forward with your arms and try to walk slowly for a bit. There is no obstacle in front of you and eventually the sight becomes clearer. You look back and notice that the tower is completly gone. You only see the bare ground. Everything within about 100 meters just vanished."
MERCENARY_DONE,"There is nothing left to do here. You are still confused and don't know what to do. You just now realize that you're still holding the handles in your hand. The paper disappeared but the handles remained. Maybe you can find a clue of what happened."
MERCENARY_ENDING_RETURNED,"You returned to the closest city, unsure of what to do now."
EXPLORER_INIT,"You heard rumours of ancient ruins holding powerful artifacts and decided to investigate them. You found out about their location. Some people gave you warnings about the ruins. But why would you care about their superstitions?"
EXPLORER_RUINS_LOCATION,"The ruins are located on a hill surrounded by a forest. You are deep inside the forest and have almost reached your destination."
EXPLORER_RUINS_FOREST_ENCOUNTER,"You see a {name} ahead. It has not seen you yet."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_ENGAGE,"You engage the {name}."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_AVOID,"You have avoided the {name}."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_SPOTTED,"Unfortunately the {name} has spotted you!"
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_SPELL,"You cast a spell and manage to distract the {name}. While it does not pay attention to you, you slip past it without being noticed."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_SNEAK,"You manage to remain absolutely silent while moving past the {name}."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_MISS,"You aim carefully but the {name} has spotted you in the last moment and your arrow misses."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_HIT,"You aim carefully and hit the {name}! The attack was not enough to kill the {name} though."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_KILL,"Your arrow hits the {name} right between its eyes. It appears to be dead and you continue your journey."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_ATTACK,"The {name} attacks you!"
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_DEFEATED,"Now that you have defeated the {name} you continue your journey."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENCOUNTER_ESCAPE,"You managed to escape! Soon enough you have lost sight of the {name} and continue your journey."
EXPLORER_RUINS_FOUND,"You reach a clearing from which you can see the hill you are heading to. You can already make out some artificial structures which are supposedly the ruins you are looking for."
EXPLORER_RUINS_REACHED,"Finally, you arrive at the site. You see many collapsed stone walls. Many of them are overgrown with plants. There is one low buildings that looks to be in a somewhat good shape. However, the door is broken."
EXPLORER_RUINS_EXAMINE_DOOR,"Examine the door."
EXPLORER_RUINS_DOOR,"The door consists of hard wood which is in a pretty good state considering its age and the rusted steel. It was, however, broken into pieces. It was destroyed presumably with axes. This place might have been visited by raiders already."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER,"Enter the ruins."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTERED,"You enter the ruins. It is pretty dark inside so you light your torch."
EXPLORER_RUINS_DUST,"You find yourself in a wide corridor. Everything is dusty and large cobwebs hand from the ceilings. At the end of the corridors lies another large broken door. You go through the door and find a staircase leading down."
EXPLORER_RUINS_GOING_DOWNSTAIRS,"You descend the long and winded staircase. You arrive at another long corridor. The air is stuffy and heavy. In the middle of the corridor lies a corpse of another adventurer."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CORPSE,"The adventurer died not long ago, probably just a few days ago. A few darts stick out from his neck. The injuries are nor lethal on their own. The darts must be poisoned. There are probably many traps in here and this poor guy triggered one of them - a reminder for you to proceed carefully."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TRAP_TRIGGERED,"You decide to ignore the dead adventurer and walk to the end of the corridor. However, a few steps further you step on a tile that slightly gives in under your feet. Suddenly a spear shoots forward from the closer walls and hits your leg. Luckily the mechanism is in a pretty bad shape so that the spear stopped earlier than it is supposed to be. Therefore you end up with onöy a small scretch on your leg - a reminder for you to proceed carefully."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CORRIDORS,"The corridor splits. In which direction do you want to go?"
EXPLORER_RUINS_DEAD_ADVENTURERS,"You turn to the left corridor. The first thing you noticed are the dead adventurers lieing on the floor. Crusted blood covers the floor. The nearest body has a large wound on his back. He was killed while trying to flee. The other bodies have large wounds as well. They were killed by swords or axes."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CORRIDOR_STRAIGT_RIGHT,"The corridor continues but there is also a door on the right side."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CANTEEN,"You arrive in a large hall with many desks and benches, maybe a canteen. The old furniture is in a bad shape. Much of it is broken and the wood is half-rotten."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER_CANTEEN,"You enter the canteen."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CANTEEN_SEARCH,"You search the hall. The room is filled with rubble and old, broken furniture. You find some {name} under a pile of rubble. They are ancient but most traders should still accept them because the material is valuable."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CANTEEN_SEARCH_FAILED,"You search the hall. The room is filled with rubble and old, broken furniture. You don't find anything useful nor any hint for why this place was abandoned."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY_FLOOR,"You go through the door and end up in a straight corridor. You just remember you earlier stepped into a trap. Maybe you should be careful here."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY_LOOK_FOR_TRAPS,"You check the floor for traps and find a tripwire. Now that you found it you can savely avoid it."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY_TRAP,"You move towards the other end of the corridor. However, you did not notice the tripwire and trigger another trap. You hear gas exhausting and after a bief moment you start to not feel well. You don't drop dead though, which is probably a good sign."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY_CORRIDOR_END,"You reach the end of the corridor. There is a heavy metal door with a key sticking in the key hole. The door is apparently open."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY,"You enter the room and find many tables and shelves containing weapons. However, due to their age most of them are covered with rust. They are pretty much useless in this state. You find a locked chest but you have no keys to open it."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER_ARMORY,"You enter the armory."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY_CHEST,"You pick the chest's lock and open the chest. You find some {name} and a rancid potion. It is light brown, almost clear, and black lumps cover the bottom of the flask. You decide that it is not safe to drink and old, rancid potion and leave it behind."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ARMORY_CHEST_FAILED,"You try your best to open the chest but the old mechanism won't budget."
EXPLORER_RUINS_JUNCTION,"You end up in a junction. There are four corridors leading in different directions."
EXPLORER_RUINS_BARRACKS,"This room contains many beds - or what is left of them - ligned up in two rows on both sides."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER_BARRACKS,"You enter the barracks."
EXPLORER_RUINS_BARRACKS_SEARCHED,"You search the room and find a few {name} in some of the chest in this room. Furthermore you find a broken lever. Maybe you'll need one later on, so you pick it up."
EXPLORER_RUINS_BARRACKS_SEARCHED_FAILED,"You search the room but you were not able to find anything useful. The only thing you find is a broken lever. Maybe you'll need one later on, so you pick it up."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER_STORAGE,"You enter the storage room."
EXPLORER_RUINS_STORAGE,"The room appears to be a storage room. On the left side you see many crates, some of which are broken. There are a few rows of shelves. You also see a door on the other side of the room right in front of you."
EXPLORER_RUINS_STORAGE_SEARCH,"You spend some time on searching all the creates, but you don't have any means to open the crates and the broken ones only contain useless rubble. However, you find a {item} under one of the shelves. The other group of adventurers must have lost it."
EXPLORER_RUINS_STORAGE_SEARCH_FAILED,"You spend some time on searching all the creates, but you don't have any means to open the crates and the broken ones only contain useless rubble."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER_SHRINE,"You enter the shrine."
EXPLORER_RUINS_SHRINE,"The room is pretty small. There are a few benches and in the center of the room is an altar surrounded by statues, probably the depiction of some ancient gods. Nothing about it looks familiar to you."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CHALICE,"You notice a chalice standing on the altar."
EXPLORER_RUINS_EXAMINE_CHALICE,"Examine the chalice."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CHALICE_DESC,"The challice is filled with a red liquid."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CHALICE_DELICIOUS,"It looks delicious."
EXPLORER_RUINS_CHALICE_POISONOUS,"It looks poisonous."
EXPLORER_RUINS_DRINK_CHALICE,"You drink from the chalice. At first the taste is pleasant but after a brief moment you feel pain. You drop the chalice and spit out the liquid. It was poisonous - at least you don't feel well."
EXPLORER_RUINS_ENTER_WORKSHOP,"You enter the workshop."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP,"You enter a room with many workbenches and various tools lieing around on the floor.\nThere is another dead adventurer in this room."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP_ADVENTURER,"The body has a deep wound on the chest. The adventurer was killed with a large slash weapon."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP_ANOTHER_ADVENTURER,"Pretty much like the other guy you have found before."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP_ADVENTURER_SCROLL,"He is holding a very nice scroll in his hand."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP_LEVER,"You see a spot where a lever could be missing."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP_INSERT_LEVER,"You insert the lever and trigger it. You hear a loud grinding noise comming from the door of the locked room."
EXPLORER_ATTACH_LEVER,"Attach the lever."
SCROLL_TAKE_LOOK,"Take a look at the scroll."
EXPLORER_RUINS_WORKSHOP_SCROLL,"The paper of the scroll has a high quality and golden ornaments cover the handles. It looks pretty new even though everything in these ruins looks very old and worn down. But there is also something else. Something about the scroll feels very important."
EXPLORER_TAKE_SCROLL,"You pick up the scroll. You hope it is valuable."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_LOCKED,"You see a huge door in front of you. It seams to be locked. You have to open it somehow."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_ENCOUNTER,"You go back to the previously locked door and find it open. However, you don't have the opportunity to explore the room that lies behind the door. A large metallic construct approaches you. It has large blades as hands and they are tainted with dried blood."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_CREATURE,"This must be the creature that killed the other adventurers."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_RUN,"You don't expect to be able to defeat the creature so you begin running towards the exit."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_RUN_ESCAPE,"Fortunately, you are faster than the creature. You have lost sight of it when you arrived at the corridor leading to the staircase. However, a door blocks the only way out!"
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_RUN_ESCAPE_FAILED,"You can't turn back because the creature is probably right around the corner so you run to the other corridor leading to the armory. But the creature is already approaching from this direction. There must be a hidden corridor between the workshop and the armory."
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_RUN_FOLLOWED,"Fortunately, the creature is not faster than you. You hope that it will not be able to follow you through the narrow staircase. However, when you arrive there, a door blocks the way out!"
EXPLORER_RUINS_TEMPLE_NO_ESCAPE,"With no way to escape you wonder what to do. For whatever reason you don't understand the only thing that comes to your mind is the scroll that you found earlier."
EXPLORER_READ_SCROLL,"You're not sure what you are doing here, but you open the scroll anyway."
EXPLORER_BLACK_OUT,"Walls begin to shift and the creature vanishes behind a wall moving in front of you. Bricks move through the air and clouds of sand rise up. You're not sure what is going on. The sand blocks your view and everything becomes darker and darker and you black out."
EXPLORER_WAKE_UP,"You wake up in a bed. There is a window in the room and it is bright outside. This is odd because the last thing you remember is passing out in a dungeon. You stand up and get dressed."
EXPLORER_ENTER_INN,"You open the door and leave the room. The building you're in is apparently an inn. You try to find the exit when a women approaches you and says: ''You're finally awake!''"
ASK_WHAT_HAPPENED,"''What happened?''"
ASK_WHERE_AM_I,"''Where am I?''"
EXPLORER_INN_WHAT,"''We found you unconscious in the cellar of {name}. Just how did you end up there?''"
EXPLORER_INN_WHERE,"''This is the inn. Oh, the city? It's {city}. How comes you don't know? Are you really alright?''\nYou don't remember a city with this name but the ruins are called like that."
SAY_DONT_KNOW,"''I don't know...''"
SHOW_HER_SCROLL,"Show her the scroll."
SAY_NONE_BUSINESS,"''That's none of your buiseness.''"
EXPLORER_INN_DONT_KNOW,"You don't know what is going on here. The last thing you remember was reading a mysterious scroll. Maybe you should try to find out something about it."
EXPLORER_INN_SCROLL,"The last thing you remember was reading a mysterious scroll. You look for the scroll in your bag but only the handles of the scroll are remaining.\n''What is this?''\nMaybe they will help you to find a clue."
EXPLORER_CITY,"You step outside and find yourself in a rather large city - too large to possibly miss it. You wonder how you ended up in this place. You start exploring the city and realize that the hills outside the city walls look familiar. On a closer look the surroundings of the city look exactly like the place where the ruins were located, but now there is a city on the hill where the ruins were."

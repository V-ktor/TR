## About

This is a currently unnamed text-based RPG/adventure game with a fantasy setting. It is also supposed to be a framework to make this kind of games with Godot Engine (which is probably hard due to my coding style and almost no comments in the code).

These are the project files for Godot 3.3.2. It's meant to be opened or run using Godot's project manager. See https://godotengine.org/
